# ![](images/icons/shutdown-32x32.png) Todo

* Provide credits in the actual application, possibly in a CREDITS text file

* Add "see also" / "similar projects" section to README

* Also, link to the repo from within the app

* Start Menu

* Unfocused window state

* Reliably focus window contents (i.e. for keyboard shortcuts in Paint)

* File save and open dialogs

* Integrate [winamp2-js](https://github.com/captbaritone/winamp2-js)

* Integrate Minesweeper better (i.e. with menus)

* Integrate Paint better

	* Windows that pop out; will need to display graphics via data URIs or canvases, and rely on inline and/or scoped styles
	
	* Setting the wallpaper
	
	* Submenus need to go in front of the window; might need to traverse the DOM looking at computed `z-index` styles

* Integrate [Pipes screensaver](https://github.com/1j01/pipes)

* Integrate Blue Screen of Death similar to http://fakebsod.com/generic

	* Press <kbd>~</kbd> or something to bluescreen

	* Prankily wait for next user input before fullscreening and bluescreening

* Try integrating arbitrary applications by emulating Windows 98 on the webpage [with v86](https://github.com/copy/v86/blob/master/docs/api.md),
with an X server installed in the VM, and acting as an X client externally??
And integrating a virtual filesystem??
That would be undoubtedly cool, but idk how hard it might be,
and especially what data channels are available between the VM and the host.
