Try it [as part of 98](https://98.js.org/) <!--or [standalone](https://98.js.org/programs/explorer/)-->

I'm planning on having this be (or serve as) both Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer,
which seems to be like *basically / essentially* the vision behind Windows 98, just not fully realized.
Y'know? Like they [added](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer#Windows_98_and_Windows_Desktop_Update) a bunch of features from Internet Explorer to Windows Explorer, but presumably it wasn't feasible, partially from a technical perspective and partially from a design perspective.


### TODO

- Prevent text selection in folder view
- Open local HTML files
- Add menus and toolbars and junk
