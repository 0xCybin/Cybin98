Try it [as part of 98](http://98.js.org/) <!--or [standalone](http://98.js.org/programs/explorer/)-->

I'm planning on having this be (or serve as) both Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer,
which seems to be like *basically / essentially* the vision behind Windows 98, just not fully realized.
I don't know.

### TODO

- Fix functional rectangle for marquee selection (needs to account for address bar)
- Prevent text selection
- Make folders open with explorer (externally)
- Navigate to folders within explorer
- Open webpages
- Add menus and toolbars
