# ![](../../images/icons/folder-open-32x32.png) Explorer

Try it [as part of 98](https://98.js.org/) <!--or [standalone](https://98.js.org/programs/explorer/)-->

This application should function as both Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer.

### TODO

- Prevent text selection in folder view
- Proxy with a service worker to load files from the virtual filesystem
- Proxy to the live web to enable injecting a user agent stylesheet, thematic context menus, history navigation, etc.
  - Show a big warning message for password fields
  - Use multiple subdomains if possible
- Status bar
- Menu bar
- Draggable toolbars, including menu bar (code should be reusable for taskbar as well)
