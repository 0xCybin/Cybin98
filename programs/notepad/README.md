# ![](../../images/icons/notepad-32x32.png) Notepad

Try it [as part of 98](https://98.js.org/) or [standalone](https://98.js.org/programs/notepad/)


### TODO

* Determine copy/cut/paste-ability when opening menus and keep the options enabled (currently the menus update at several other times)

* Help > About Notepad
  * Link back to 98 in case the app is opened standalone
  * Maybe link to this README

* Help > Help Topics

* Search (altho you can use the browser's <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd>)

* Edit > Set Font
